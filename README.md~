# denpa-qr-edit
a to-be mantained, and improved version of [denpa-qr-code-editor](https://github.com/CaitSith2/denpa-qr-code-editor).
## What features it should have:
* TDM2 and TDM3 mode.
* Layering parts preview.
* read QR Code from camera
* and more i can't think of as of writing this
## Used libraries
* [zbar](https://pypi.org/project/pyzbar/)

## A fair warning.
Like the rest of all the things on my github, this is a labor of love, as such, i may not work on this *TOO* much, ergo, i'll probably take my time wrapping this up.
